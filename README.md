# PriloRectangleController
A digital controller PCB/chassis design meant to be easy to order and assemble while remaining a professional feeling and relatively customizable product.

HEAVILY inspired by GCCMX from Crane1195, which this repository was forked from.

ToDo: Replace these images with images made from this repository's files (these are from Crane's original repo)

The PCB is design to allow easy surface mount soldering of a Raspberry Pi Pico, the preferred board for DIY rectangle controllers in the community currently. It is also designed to easily solder a [Model U](https://github.com/Crane1195/Model-U) to with headers.

The PCB is originally designed to allow mounting a Model S and a Brook board, but you can also just solder wires to the through holes. The pin holes are labeled on the silk screen of the board.

## Parts:
1. [2.54mm pitch low profile header](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/samtec-inc/TLW-136-05-T-S/1105024) (allows for thinner rectangle. alternatively use regular (2.50mm insulatio height) headers and allow for an extra 0.98mm of clearance in the case)
2. [M6 size fastener bolts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QF7VB9P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
